# SoftwareDevelopmentLifecycle

User needs are the guiding principle for any development project, with the developer seeking to achieve success  by understanding a project goal and completing it accurately. The user stories are helpful in breaking down individual tasks and overarching goals that need to be achieved for each step of the project. User stories also enable development teams to see the product from the perspective of an end user and participating as if they were a user. From this frame of mind, the team can develop the test cases to ensure that the users are given the features that they had asked for and exactly how to achieve these goals. They are helpful from an organizational perspective and as a point of clarity to the client and user needs.

I will approach the development of any program with a clear understanding of the project, asking for clarification if necessary to achieve this. I plan to incorporate regular sprint meetings with any teamt that I should work with in order to create the best possible software that meets the desired goal. I will also implement retrospectives which will be helpful in reflecting on the project and improving the process. A good team member will continually try to improve their process and communicate clearly and concisely with other team members.
